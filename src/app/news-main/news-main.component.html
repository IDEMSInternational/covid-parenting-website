        <p>
          To help prevent violence and abuse against children during the COVID-19 pandemic, in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and other leading agencies, Parenting for Lifelong Health (PLH) provides open-source and evidence-based parenting resources to help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis on families, and support parents, caregivers, teachers, nurses, and others in keeping children safe under all circumstances. 
        </p>          
        <p>
          These resources focus on building positive parent-child relationships and reducing violence against children by learning through play, reinforcing positive and managing difficult behaviours, creating structure and routines, talking about COVID-19, keeping children safe online, and reducing stress and conflict.
        </p>

          The COVID-19 Playful Parenting team's efforts are grounded in 5 core principles:
        </p>
                  <ul>
            <li>
              Evidence-based materials and approaches, with in-built mechanisms for ongoing evaluation and knowledge gathering
            </li>
            <li>
              Open-source and non-commercial content and configurations, giving free access to resources
            </li>
            <li>
              Scalable and low-cost designs and dissemination routes, to reach all parents who need support
            </li>
            <li>
              Adaptive messaging and methods, to meet the needs of diverse local cultures and contexts across the globe
            </li>
            <li>
              Playful and empathic scope and spirit, because learning through playful and compassionate interaction are the key to positive parenting and child wellbeing
            </li>
          </ul>
