            Parenting for Lifelong Health (PLH) provides open-source and evidence-based playful parenting resources to
            support
            parents and caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. These resources focus on building positive
            parent-child relationships and reducing
            violence against children by learning through play, reinforcing positive and managing difficult behaviours,
            creating structure and routines, talking about COVID-19, keeping children safe online, and reducing stress
            and conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are working with the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, the Global Partnership to End Violence
            Against Children, USAID, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Oxford University, the LEGO
            Foundation, the Internet of Good Things
