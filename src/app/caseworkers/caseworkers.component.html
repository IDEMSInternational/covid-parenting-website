                  We have designed special parenting tip sheets to be used by social workers for behavioral parent training, to help parents build positive parent-child relationships through play, reinforcing positive and managing difficult behaviours, creating structure and routines, talking about COVID-19, keeping children safe online, and reducing stress and conflict.
