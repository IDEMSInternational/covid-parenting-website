                    warns Oxford professor, Lucie Cluver. </p>


                <p style="text-align:justify">A child loses an important caregiver to the coronavirus every six seconds, says Lucie Cluver, a professor of child and family social work at Oxford University and the co-leader of the COVID-19 Emergency Parenting Response.</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    According to Cluver, those staggering numbers will continue to rise: “In April, there were 1.5 million children who had lost a caregiver. Now, in November, there are 5.2 million children. Within the next year, there are going to be 10 million children.”

                    The COVID-19
                    pandemic has been making life difficult for parents around the world. In these
                    exceptional circumstances, many have struggled to give children the care and education
                    they need. Stuck at home, families from lower-socioeconomic backgrounds have been
                    particularly affected, says Jamie Lachman, an Oxford University researcher who
                    co-founded the Parenting for Lifelong Health (PLH) initiative, a collaboration between
                    WHO, Stellenbosch University and the University of Cape Town in South Africa, the
                    universities of Oxford, Bangor, and Reading in the United Kingdom, and UNICEF. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Factors such as increased financial stress and cramped living
                    conditions have made it
                    even harder to create a positive home learning environment, he says. “[Parents] are
                    spending more time with their children, and the question is: what’s the quality of that
                    time?”</p>
