                    <p style="text-align:justify">Lockdowns threaten child development – can parenting programmes help? The COVID-19
                        pandemic has been making life difficult for parents around the world. In these
                        exceptional circumstances, many have struggled to give children the care and education
                        they need. Stuck at home, families from lower-socioeconomic backgrounds have been
                        particularly affected, says Jamie Lachman, an Oxford University researcher who
                        co-founded the Parenting for Lifelong Health (PLH) initiative, a collaboration between
                        WHO, Stellenbosch University and the University of Cape Town in South Africa, the
                        universities of Oxford, Bangor, and Reading in the United Kingdom, and UNICEF. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">Factors such as increased financial stress and cramped living conditions have made it
                        even harder to create a positive home learning environment, he says. “[Parents] are
                        spending more time with their children, and the question is: what’s the quality of that
                        time?”</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify">Ending all violence against children by 2030 is a core

part of Sustainable Development Goals 5 and 16. A

number of promising violence reduction strategies have

been identified in research studies. However, we lack an

understanding of the implementation and impact of these

programs in respect to their delivery at a large scale or

within existing service systems, particularly in low- and

middle-income countries (LMICs).</p>
