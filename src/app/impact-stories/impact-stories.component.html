        To help prevent violence and abuse against children during the COVID-19 pandemic, in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and other leading agencies, Parenting for Lifelong Health (PLH) provides open-source and evidence-based parenting resources to help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis on families, and support parents, caregivers, teachers, nurses, and others in keeping children safe under all circumstances. 
      </p>
<p>The COVID-19 Playful Parenting team's efforts are grounded in 5 core principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Evidence-based materials and approaches, with in-built mechanisms for ongoing evaluation and knowledge gathering.</li>
    <li>Open-source and non-commercial content and configurations, giving free access to resources.</li>
    <li>Scalable and low-cost designs and dissemination routes, to reach all parents who need support</li>
    <li>Adaptive messaging and methods, to meet the needs of diverse local cultures and contexts across the globe.</li>
    <li>Playful and empathic scope and spirit, because learning through playful and compassionate interaction are the key to positive parenting and child wellbeing.</li>
  </ul>

<p>
  Our Partners have been incredibly supportive of the COVID-19 Parenting Emergency Response
 Project! By sharing our parenting materials across the world they have contributed to
 achieving the milestone of reaching
 more than {{ totalRegionSummary | number }}
 to date. 
</p>

<p>
  These resources focus on building positive parent-child relationships and reducing violence against children by learning through play, reinforcing positive and managing difficult behaviours, creating structure and routines, talking about COVID-19, keeping children safe online, and reducing stress and conflict.
