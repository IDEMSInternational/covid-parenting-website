                            An estimated 1.5 million children worldwide have experienced the death of a parent,
                            custodial grandparent, or other relative who cared for them, as a result of COVID-19,
                            according to a new study published in The Lancet, and carried out by carried out
                            by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control COVID-19 Response Team, the University

                            Children who have lost a parent or caregiver are at risk of profound short- and long-term
                            adverse effects on their health, safety, and wellbeing, such as increasing the risk of
                            disease, physical abuse, sexual violence, and adolescent pregnancy. The researchers
                            call for urgent action to address the impact of caregiver deaths on children into COVID-19
                            response plans.

                            Dr Susan Hillis, one of the lead authors on the study, from the U.S. Centers for Disease
                            Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response Team says: “For every two COVID-19 deaths
                            worldwide, one child is left behind to face the death of a parent or caregiver.
                            By April 30, 2021, these 1.5 million children had become the tragic overlooked consequence
                            of the 3 million COVID-19 deaths worldwide, and this number will only increase as the
                            pandemic progresses [1]. Our findings highlight
                            the urgent need to prioritize these children and invest in evidence-based programs and
                            services to protect and support them right now and to continue to support them for many
                            years into the future – because orphanhood does
                            not go away.”

                            Africa, says: “We have strong evidence from HIV and Ebola to guide solutions. We need to
                            support extended families or foster families to care for children, with
                            cost-effective economic strengthening, parenting programs, and school access. We need to
                            vaccinate caregivers of children – especially grandparent caregivers. And we need to respond
                            fast because every 12 seconds a child loses
                            their caregiver to COVID."

                            Before this report, there were no global figures to quantify how many children have been
                            affected by the loss of a caregiver during the COVID-19 pandemic, either directly (due to
                            the virus) or indirectly (due to another condition that was exacerbated
                            due to the pandemic). The study’s researchers developed mathematical models using the best
                            available data as an initial attempt to estimate the magnitude of this hidden impact of the
                            pandemic on children. </p>

                            Professor Cathy Ward’s exceptional dedication to violence prevention and outstanding
                            welfare-related research has been recognised with the 2020 University of Cape Town (UCT)
                            prestigious Alan Pifer Award.</p>
                        <p>
                            Growing up during apartheid, Professor Cathy Ward became aware of the systemic nature of
                            violence in South Africa and its devastating effects on society at a young age.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This sparked her interest in research around violence prevention and has led to the creation
                            of Parenting for Lifelong Health (PLH), a suite of not for profit, open access and
                            evidence-based programmes for low-resource settings that deal with conflict
                            at home and help create positive and safe environments for children.

                            Over a short period, PLH has had an outstanding impact on South African society and
                            continues to improve the lives of families daily. An estimated 81 000 cases of child abuse
                            have been directly averted through these programmes, which use mechanisms such
                            as comic strips and roleplay to keep costs low and make the content more accessible.

                            broadcasted the COVID-19 Playful Parenting Tips in 5 local languages (Lamso,
                            Pidgin, Oku, Mankon, and Aghem), reaching an estimated population of over 50,000 people.
                            These represent three administrative divisions of Bui, Mezam, Menchum, and Donga Mantung of
                            the NW Region of Cameroon. These divisions
                            run across mostly rural and semi-urban communities with only one urban community. The radio

                            The task of disseminating COVID-19 Playful Parenting Tips to the broader international
                            community required the assistance of a strong, community-based network. World Without
                            Orphans (WWO), a global collaborative of faith-based organizations and faith community
                            networks took a leading role in that effort.

                            COVID-19 has brought unprecedented challenges for families across the globe. UNICEF India
                            has been a key partner in navigating this pandemic by providing families and caregivers with
                            accurate and reliable information on the best ways to keep families
                            safe.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            UNICEF India has translated the playful Parenting tip sheets into 10 languages and used them
                            for capacity building within government systems through online training sessions, mainly
                            focusing on Early Childhood Development (ECD) workers and caregivers.
                            They transcripted these tips into a monthly calendar to be shared with parents along with
                            training and informative activities. The tips were then developed into short videos that
                            have been used on the Saathealth app. Additionally,
                            UNICEF India shared the tips in approximately 70,000 WhatsApp groups, reaching an estimated
                            million parents.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The government has also been involved in sharing these tips on their websites and promoting
                            them to parents, especially in rural villages.
                        </p>
                        UNICEF India has also launched the project ADAPT that focuses on adolescents, and has used the
                        tips, with others, to create short videos that encourage intergenerational dialogue. They have
                        since held multiple webinars with healthcare workers who have
                        requested the tip sheets to print and display in their offices/surgeries.

                            In its new podcast series, the End Violence Partnership explores the answer to that question
                            by talking to those on the frontlines – the experts, researchers and leaders that have

                            Dr Lucie Cluver, Professor of Child and Family Social Work at the University of Oxford and
                            University of Cape Town, about evidence-based social interventions
                            and how data can improve the lives of children and adolescents around the world. Dr. Cluver
                            also talks about playful parenting as a key element for nurturing care and connection in
                            children’s lives, especially during COVID-19,
                            and shares useful playful parenting tips.

                            There were maternity wards that transformed into ghost towns overnight, as visitor
                            restrictions tightened and grandparents-to-be canceled flights. Schools closed, then
                            reopened, only to close again, sending parents scrambling for child care, wrangling
                            remote learners and struggling to do their own jobs. Millions of families lost income and
                            many lost loved ones. For parents in particular, this year has meant recalibrating time and
                            again. Yet, there was also joy — cobbled-together
                            peaceful moments — amid a steady thrum of chaos, which isn’t letting up. We asked mothers
                            and fathers across the country what playful parenting has been like for them during the
                            pandemic and how, in their own ways, they have
                            each learned to cope.

                            Since March 2020, the COVID-19 Playful Parenting Resources have reached more than 196
                            million people globally, helping to reduce violence against children and improving child
                            wellbeing during the pandemic. This award recognises the significant impact of these
                            resources, which have shown to reduce child abuse and parenting stress, as well as improve
                            parent-child relationships and coping strategies amongst families around the world.

                            Reacting to the award, Dr Lachman and Professor Cluver said, ‘We are delighted to receive
                            this recognition for the impact of our research that was made possible by an unprecedented
                            global collaboration across sectors in such a time of crisis. The impacts of COVID-19 will
                            continue to affect the lives of children and families for many years. Our research teams
                            continue to work together with partners to make sure that every parent, everywhere has
                            access to evidence-based parenting support that is accessible, informative, and useful.’
