                        Our Digital Parenting resources are tools that have been conceived and designed to reach parents
                        through digital formats such as online and/or mobile applications, texting and chat services.

                            Due to the impact of COVID-19, it is more challenging for in-person parenting programmes to
                            reach families in need. ParentChat is a newly developed online version of the Parenting for
                            Lifelong Health programmes for young children and adolescents, which will be delivered
                            through
                            online messaging services such as WhatsApp or Viber. The programme aims to improve
                            parent-child
                            relationships and child well-being, reduce child maltreatment and to increase the
                            availability
                            of parenting programmes for vulnerable families.

                        <p>
                            The programme will run for 8 weeks and is available for parents who have children between
                            the ages of 2 to 17. Each week of the programme includes 2 chat sessions, each lasting one
                            hour, with a trained facilitator who will guide parents through evidence-based parenting
                            tips and activities. In these chat sessions, facilitators will discuss ways to strengthen
                            the parent-child relationship through group conversation, activities and storytelling,
                            covering themes including:
                        </p><br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Relationship building through one-on-one time with your children (e.g., quality time,
                                talking about emotions, taking a pause)</li>
                            <li>Positive reinforcement of positive behaviour (e.g., praise, giving clear and positive
                                instructions, establishing routines and rules)</li>
                            <li>Coping with difficulties (e.g., positive discipline, managing difficult child behaviour,
                                handling crises)</li>

                        <p>
                            Parents will be encouraged to give regular feedback regarding successes and challenges
                            applying these parenting skills in the online group chat. The facilitator will then provide
                            a brief summary of the feedback and address possible solutions to 2-3 key challenges.
                            Throughout the week the facilitator will also provide interactive learning experiences
                            through helpful tips, fun activities, and reminders, to help parents develop and apply the
                            skills they have learnt across the entire programme.

                        <p>
                            ParentText is an automated text messaging service for parents of children aged 0 to 17. It
                            is
                            delivered using RapidPro, an open-source application serving low-income communities without
                            smartphone access, and also through text messaging platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and
                            Facebook messenger. Text message and free social media messaging services have the potential
                            reach to an estimated 70% of the world population, including those with basic handsets.
                            Parents
                            are recruited through social media, implementing partners, government agencies, schools,
                            clinics, grocery stores, and radio and T.V. broadcasts. The application supports multiple
                            languages, including English and local languages.
                        </p><br>

                        <h5>Recruitment of parents</h5>
                        <p>
                            In order to maximise engagement, enrolment is possible via multiple processes either by
                            following a QR code, clicking on a weblink, or sending a message to a prespecified number.
                            Once
                            they have enrolled, parents with even basic feature phones are able to select the data usage
                            package they wish to receive with free messages that can include both texts as well as
                            images,
                            GIFs, animations, and videos.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Parents are also able to choose from basic, medium and high data use options. Parents
                            without
                            data packages may even receive text messages via SMS where available, especially if there
                            are
                            existing agreements between service providers and telecommunication companies for zero-rated
                            messages.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <h5>Content based on stages of child development</h5>
                        <p>
                            ParentText targets parents with children aged 0 to 17 and contains specific content based on
                            development stages for parents of children aged 0-23 months, 2-9 years, 10-17 years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Messages are delivered to parents over an average of 5 weeks depending on the frequency
                            selected
                            by parents. The content of the ParentText message delivery system is derived from the PLH
                            evidence-based parenting programmesthat have been rigorously tested in Asia. The messages
                            are
                            grouped into three main themes: 1) Relationship building by spending time together, 2)
                            Positive
                            reinforcement (i.e., praise, daily routines, and child behaviour management), and 3) Stress
                            reduction for parents and caregivers. Additional content is available including specific
                            support
                            for parents of children living with disabilities, child development, online child safety,
                            talking about COVID19 with children, family budgeting, family harmony, helping with
                            schoolwork,
                            and sexual violence prevention.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <h5>User experience</h5>
                        <p>Parents experience the text message delivery system in three ways: </p>
                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>Scheduled text messages,</li>
                            <li>On-demand content and</li>
                            <li>Weekly assessments.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>
                            Scheduled text messages include daily activities tailored by child age (e.g., “Spend 20
                            minutes
                            of One-on-One Time each day with your children – tell them a story from your own childhood),
                            reminders, (‘Remember - 20 minutes of One-on-One Time with your child will increase their
                            brain
                            development’) and responses (‘You did it! Well done - you are a star!’).
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            On-demand content allows for user-directed engagement in which parents and caregivers
                            self-select content that is most relevant to their context and developmental stage of their
                            children, as well as two- way interaction and feedback.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Weekly assessments examines the impact of the messages on parenting, parental stress, and
                            child
                            behaviour by collecting fully anonymised data (opt-in) at registration and weekly intervals.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The ParentText message delivery system also has the capability to help parents solve
                            challenges
                            with their children based on typical challenges faced by parents in similar situations, and
                            information parents provide about their own circumstance. Much like a chatbot you may have
                            interacted with through your banking system or when booking an airline ticket (although more
                            empathic and engaging!), the system offers conversation-like tips in response to parents’
                            requests. Lastly, the text messages provide opportunities for referrals to local resources
                            (e.g., domestic abuse and mental health hotlines, health clinics, and child protection
                            services).
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <h5>Safeguarding of Messages</h5>
                        <p>
                            Users of automated services often try to get other forms of help by messaging the chatbot
                            and
                            disclosing personal situations in the free text fields. These users might include women and
                            children at risk and survivors of violence, whose numbers are increasing during the COVID-19
                            pandemic. Users at risk of violence who attempt to disclose their situation or ask for help
                            often receive no acknowledgement or support from typical chatbot services. Based on UNICEF
                            chatbot safeguarding guidelines, ParentText is designed to recognise high risk keywords to
                            detect possible disclosure of a dangerous situation in free text fields. After detection,
                            the
                            chatbot is automated to offer the user an empathetic and empowering response and contact
                            details
                            on where to access professional or urgent help (e.g. police, ambulance, hotline).

                        ParentApp is an app version of the Parenting for Lifelong Health for Parents and Teens (PLH for
                        Teens) programme, designed for parents and caregivers of adolescents aged 10 to 17 years. It is
                        designed to complement in-person programme delivery and can be used as a self-led option or
                        combined with remote facilitator support. It aims to deliver free evidence-based parenting
                        support and child abuse prevention in multiple languages and an adaptable design

                        <strong>Background: </strong> COVID-19 has increased violence against children and adolescents
                        by 30-50% (UNICEF 2020). While parenting programmes are the most effective intervention (WHO
                        2020), restrictions on movement and group meetings have disrupted traditional parenting
                        programmes. <a

                        <strong>ParentApp: </strong> ParentApp: Working with families in South Africa, Kenya and other
                        African countries, we have developed ParentApp, an open-source app-based version of the PLH for
                        Teens programme. The app is developed for offline use to remain effective when used in rural
                        areas or where there is no internet or affordable data.

                        <strong>Content:</strong> ParentApp covers simple and effective strategies to build habits,
                        reduce conflict, and support positive parenting. Through 12 weeks of content, including
                        introductory and closing sessions, it addresses:

                        <strong>Experience:</strong> Parents join interactive <strong>Weekly Workshops</strong> which
                        cover the core programmatic content and can be done alone or in a group. The workshops are
                        interspersed with <strong> scheduled messages</strong> of praise, reminders to relax,
                        suggestions of family
                        activities and encouraging check-ins that aim to keep parents engaged. Parents can log
                        <strong>ParentPoints</strong> based on tasks completed and use this fun habit-tracker to track
                        their success in
                        self-care and positive parenting behaviours. Furthermore, parents have access to the
                        ParentLibrary which includes resources on-demand, and provides instant access to essential tools
                        and activities, information on local support resources, information on COVID-19 prevention and
                        more. ParentApp adapts to each user’s needs by giving content when people need it and adjusting
                        responses to their progress and challenges. It is built on the premise that parents want more
                        than content - they value the experience of being appreciated.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Local contextualisation:</strong> ParentApp is easily tailored by partners to best
                        support their communities and to fit local resources, languages, names and existing systems of
                        delivering services. The open-source, modular design of the app ensures it is adaptable to
                        future extensions.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Monitoring and evaluation:</strong> An integrated M&E system, being built into the
                        behavioural system and
                        user experience of the app, allows tracking of user engagement, participation, retention and
                        outcomes such as positive parenting, child maltreatment, parenting stress, parent self-efficacy
                        and child behaviour problems at baseline and endline. Additional quantitative and qualitative
                        research components implemented as part of a piloting study in South Africa and Tanzania will
                        refine and optimise the usability, acceptance, engagement and retention for users, explore
                        implementation feasibility and initial evidence of effectiveness.
