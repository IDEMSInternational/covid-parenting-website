        <h5>Take Our Monitoring &Evaluation (M&E) Survey</h5>
        <p>
          Please take 2 minutes to complete this survey. These questions are
          important, and your answers will help us learn if the parenting tips
          you are sharing are helping parents spend more time with their
          children, manage parental stress, and help parents discipline children
          through encouraging good behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we continue to work tirelessly to create innovative approaches,
          respond to partner requests, and learn how these resources impact the
          lives of children and families, your inputs will help us understand
          how we can better support families in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          These resources focus on building positive parent-child relationships
          and reducing violence against children by learning through play,
          reinforcing positive and managing difficult behaviours, creating
          structure and routines, talking about COVID-19, keeping children safe
          online, and reducing stress and conflict.

        <h5>Take Teen Survey</h5>
        <p>
          You are parenting a teen? You have liked and used our COVID-19
          parenting tips? You can help us to develop a free parenting app by
          answering the short survey below!
        </p>
        <p>
          Adolescents are often considered the forgotten demographic in public
          health and social policy. They may be particularly vulnerable to
          certain types of violence owing to simultaneous risks of violence from
          caregivers and intimate partners and their unique physiology,
          particularly the rapid brain development that is a hallmark of
          adolescence.

          approaches, and learn how these resources impact the lives of children
          and families, your inputs will help us understand how we can better
          support families and teenagers in the future.
