        <h5>Take Our Monitoring &Evaluation (M&E) Survey</h5>
        <p>
          We would love to know more about your experience as a parent during COVID-19.  Please take 2 minutes to complete this survey and share your story - your participation and any information you provide will be used anonymously by researchers so that we learn about how to better support families like yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          These questions are important, and your answers will help us learn if the parenting tips you are sharing are helping parents spend more time with their children, manage parental stress, and discipline children through encouraging good behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we continue to work tirelessly to create innovative approaches, respond to partner requests, and learn how these resources impact the lives of children and families, your inputs will help us understand how we can better support families in the future.
